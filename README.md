# Handritten Digit Recognition GUI

## Overview
This project is a simple GUI application for handwritten digit recognition using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on the MNIST dataset. Users can draw digits (0-9) on a canvas, and the model predicts the drawn digit with a confidence score.

The application consists of two primary components:
1. **Model Training (mnist.py)**: Trains a CNN on the MNIST dataset and saves the trained model as `mnist.h5`.
2. **GUI Application (main.py)**: A Tkinter-based GUI that allows users to draw digits, predict them using the trained model, and display the results.

## Files in the Repository
- **mnist.py**: Script to train the CNN on the MNIST dataset and save the model.
- **main.py**: Script to run the GUI application for digit recognition.
- **mnist.h5**: The trained model file generated by `mnist.py`.
- **plot.png**: shows the Train, Validation Accuracy overf Epoch and Loss over Epoch.
- **predicted images**: Folder that consist of the images. The images are predicted by the model which is saved as a screenshot. Note: GUI doesnot have function saved!!

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Pillow
- Tkinter (comes pre-installed with Python)

---

## Installation Steps
1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install tensorflow numpy pillow
   ```

4. Train the model (optional, if `mnist.h5` is not available):
   ```bash
   python mnist.py
   ```

5. Run the GUI application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

---

## Usage
1. Launch the GUI by running `main.py`.
2. Use the canvas to draw a digit (0-9).
3. Click on the **Predict** button to get the predicted digit and confidence score.
4. Click on the **Clear** button to reset the canvas.

## Model Architecture
The CNN model used in this project has the following architecture:
- Input Layer: (28x28x1)
- Convolutional Layer 1: 32 filters, 3x3 kernel, ReLU activation
- Max Pooling Layer 1: 2x2 pool size
- Convolutional Layer 2: 64 filters, 3x3 kernel, ReLU activation
- Max Pooling Layer 2: 2x2 pool size
- Flatten Layer
- Dense Layer: 128 neurons, ReLU activation
- Dropout Layer: 50% dropout
- Output Layer: 10 neurons (softmax activation)

---

## GUI Features
- **Canvas**: A drawable canvas where users can draw digits.
- **Predict Button**: Predicts the digit drawn on the canvas.
- **Clear Button**: Clears the canvas.
- **Result Display**: Shows the predicted digit and confidence score.

## Dependencies
The project requires the following libraries:
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Pillow (PIL)
- Tkinter (comes with Python)

---

## Future Improvements
- Enhance the GUI with more features.
- Add more robust error handling.
- Improve model accuracy with additional training.
